# Gesture Controlled Application Launcher

## Description
This project uses computer vision to detect air-drawn gestures and trigger specific applications based on the detected pattern.
For example, drawing a straight line in the air launches a predefined application.

## Features
- Real-time hand tracking
- Gesture recognition using air-drawn patterns
- Application launching based on gestures

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe

## How It Works
The webcam captures hand movements, which are tracked and analyzed.
Predefined gesture patterns are matched, and corresponding applications are launched automatically.

## How to Run
1. Install Python
2. Install required libraries
3. Run the main Python script
4. Perform gestures in front of the camera

## Use Case
This system demonstrates touchless human-computer interaction and can be extended for smart systems and accessibility applications.
